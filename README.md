Hello, my name is Micah Schweinsberg, and welcome to my ePortfolio, where I will showcase the progress I am making during my 5-month Cybervets apprenticeship.

## ABOUT ME

My name is Micah and I’m retiring from the Air Force as a Senior Security Forces Operations Manager and Force Protection expert, with a degree in Criminal Justice from Purdue. After 20-years managing programs, overseeing operations, leading personnel and obtaining critical IT certificates. I’m now prepared to transition into the field of cybersecurity. Working in a military culture where my primary mission was to protect personnel and assets from the physical perspective, was a perfect gateway into why I choose to transition to cyber. Since I’ve had experience in crisis management, business continuity and defense in depth, I can bring my certifications, cybersecurity technical skills training with CyberVets and 20-years of military experience to make this big career change into a field I’m passionate about and protect a companies data and infrastructure.

Why Cyber?
	
I have always been drawn to Criminal Justice. I joined the Air Force with the goal of becoming a United States Marshal, but after watching how the criminal enterprise is focusing more towards criminal behavior in the cyber realm, I decided to change career paths. 
	
The part about cybersecurity that is most appealing to me is my ability to investigate crime, without having to carry a weapon which I have done for the last 20-years. I am driven and motivated by learning new things, and protecting a organization or industry from a cyber disaster. The Air Force and Security Forces taught me a lot of skills that I can carry on into this new and exciting career path.  

Future Goals

I intend to continue my education and understanding of networks, cybersecurity frameworks, along with threat and vulnerability management. 

## Education

I hold an Associates in Criminal Justice from the Community College of the Air Force , and graduated from Purdue University Global with a Bachelors of Applied Science in Criminal Justice and Law Enforcement.
