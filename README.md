Hello, my name is Micah Schweinsberg, and welcome to my ePortfolio, where I will showcase the progress I am making during my 5-month Cybervets apprenticeship.

## ABOUT ME

I was born and raised in Arvada, Colorado and I am currently stationed at Los Angeles Air Force Base in El Segundo, CA where I will finish out my military career. I have spent the last 20.6 years working in multiple management, security and leadership roles for the United States Air Force, where I  gained skills in all aspects of force protection, security, personnel protection and law enforcement. The Air Force has provided me with one Bachelor and one Associates degree, along with schooling that focused on sharping my leadership and communication ability. 

Why Cyber?
	
I have always been drawn to Criminal Justice. I joined the Air Force with the goal of becoming a United States Marshal, but after watching how the criminal enterprise is focusing more towards criminal behavior in the cyber realm, I decided to change career paths. 
	
The part about cybersecurity that is most appealing to me is my ability to investigate crime, without having to carry a weapon which I have done for the last 20-years. I am driven and motivated by learning new things, and protecting a organization or industry from a cyber disaster. The Air Force and Security Forces taught me a lot of skills that I can carry on into this new and exciting career path.  

Future Goals

I intend to continue my education and understanding of networks, cybersecurity frameworks, along with threat and vulnerability management. 

## Education

I hold an Associates in Criminal Justice from the Community College of the Air Force , and graduated from Purdue University Global with a Bachelors of Applied Science in Criminal Justice and Law Enforcement.
